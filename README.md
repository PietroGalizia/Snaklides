Description
========
SnakŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ is an educational and engaging video game that combines the classic mechanics of Snake with the exploration of geometry. Players control a "snake" that grows as it collects geometric shapes, angles, or lines, with gameplay designed to teach and reinforce knowledge about polygons, symmetry, and spatial reasoning. Perfect for students, educators, and geometry enthusiasts, SnakŒªŒµŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ makes learning geometry interactive and fun while sharpening players' strategic thinking skills.
